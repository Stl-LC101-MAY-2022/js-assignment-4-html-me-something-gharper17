      <h1>The "First Job"</h1>
      <img src = https://i.imgur.com/KJVpoTY.jpeg width = "1000" height = "1000"> 
      <br> <p>I spent many of my teen years begging for a job from entities like McDonalds, K-Mart and Burger King just to be denied until I was in college. A position feel in my lap to be a front desk attendent and I quickly found out why it was so easy. I spent most of my time not making it to the front desk for my 4am shift of my college dorm. I know the manager hated me from the way she looked at me when we cross paths. She totally deserved better.</p>
      
      <h1>The Obama Job</h1>
      <img src = https://i.imgur.com/oQ6T2Y7.jpeg width = "1000" height = "1000"> 
      <br><p>The Summer of 2010 I was blessed with the opportunity through an organization in the city to work at Castlewood State Park in Ballwin, MO. During this summer I would foster my love for the outdoors and enjoying different kinds of scenary. Our instructor would give us assignments with a 2/3 week due date. My teams plan was to knock out the work in a 2 day span then rest the rest of that time. So needless to say it was alot of time learning about each other and our different lifestyles and what we wanted to do when we grew up. That was an eye opening experience for many reason and I appreciate my time there.</p>

      <br><p>Throughout university I took time to work at Missouri Athletic Club West in Town Country. I was able to showcase my talents as the worse dishwasher in America (jk). This job was cool because I was working with two of my good friends from my middleschool days Marquis Smart and Offie Adams. Not to mention all of the good food and celebreties I was able to meet including: Dick Vermeil, Stan Musial, Kurt Warner, Matt Holiday and the whole STL Cardinals Roster.  </p>


      <h1>The Internship from Hades</h1>
      <img src = https://i.imgur.com/rmpFRCs.gif width = "1000" height = "1000"> 
      <br><p>Get an internship they said! <b>-___-</b> This was the most eye opening experience to what I did not want for a work enviornment. The manager was unstable, short tempered and unreliable. I walked into the office everyday that summer creeping around a field of mines with eggshell shoes on. The man even thought about putting me into a dumpster to retreave materials out of it.</p>
      
      <h1>The most chill and insightful internship ever</h1>
      <img src = https://i.imgur.com/1lyPUbK.jpeg width = "1000" height = "1000">    
      <br><p>This internship gave me insight into what I love about real estate, building cities and St. Louis from an architecture stand point. I worked at SIMS Building Group during the summer of 2014. It gave me the downtown city life of working at an office building, the morning commutes on the metrolink and the mid day lunches in different eateries. Overall experience was a <b>10 out of 10</b>, would recommend!</p>
      

      <h1 id= "mainHeading">America's Biggest HOAX</h1>
      <img src = https://i.imgur.com/3nKcAmp.jpeg width = "1000" height = "1000">         
      <br><p>Coming out of college I only had one job offer on the table and that was for a steel company in Burns Harbor, Indiana. Throughout the interviewing process they spoke of the enormous engineering development that comes along with this position. To say I was excited was an understatement. I knew I would have a good time and I looked forward to getting my first engineering check after many years of hard test and retaking classes. Orientation was promising meeting all these other folks there with the same ambitions. All of that came crashing down on my first day at the job. While taking lunch I wasnt greeted by random co-workers with a "Hi, how are you? Welcome to the team." it was more like "Oh, They fooled another one!". As you could imagine this came with alot of confusing to me. After further investigation my job would be nothing mmore than a maintence supervisor that was titled an "Engineer - Electrical". My incoming class and I were all overseasoned with salt by this but eventually made it out to different jobs within a 2 years time. </p>
